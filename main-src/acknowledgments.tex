\section*{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I thank to my supervisor, Prof. Atsushi Igarashi.  Without his
support, I cannot finish my thesis.  He is the most powerful and smart person
who I have met.

Second, I thank to all members in the laboratory. They made my life in my
master cource fruitful and pleasant.

At the last, I am grateful to all restaurants around the laboratory, Cofe
Collection, Matsunosuke, Kitchen Gorilla, and Mikaen. These restaurants
encourage me to proceed my research.

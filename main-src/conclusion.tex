\section{Conclusion \label{sec:conclusion}}

% What we did

We have proposed a new multi-stage calculus \LMD with dependent types, which make it possible for programmers to express finer-grained properties about the behavior of code values. Because the generated code by multi-stage programming is sometimes specialized in given inputs, it cannot be used with specific inputs. This expansion can assure it is only used with desired inputs.

% Technical Contribution

Technically, CSP and type equivalence (specially tailored for CSP) are keys to expressing dependently typed practical code generators.  We have proved basic properties of \LMD, including preservation, confluence, strong normalization for full reduction, and progress for staged reduction. Furthermore, we design algorithmic typing rules for \LMD, which we need to implement a type inference program and prove it is equivalent to original typing rules.

% Future Works

The main future work is investigating the Curry-Howard isomorphism to find a logic corresponding to \LMD. Tsukada and Igarashi \cite{Tsukada} found that a kind of modal logic corresponds to stage, and Gratzer et al. \cite{gratzer2019modaldependent} investigated a dependent type theory with modalities. However, they have not explored the CSP operator, which is the critical point of our research.
